Hi, WELCOME friend


To run the R script there are two ways -


=> Run the code line by line if you are new to R language.

                           OR

=> Install the required libraries and then run the script all at once. 


If you any question mail me to sg952@njit.edu or shubham26g1994@gmail.com

Have a good one!!!
